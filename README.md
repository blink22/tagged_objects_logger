# TaggedObjectsLogger
By [Blink22](http://www.blink22.com/).

TaggedObjectsLogger is a flexible logging solution for Rails based on the Ruby logger. It extends the functionality of the logger by adding the ability to log errors, warnings, info, bugs and unknown messages in a custom format efficiently and easily.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tagged_objects_logger'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tagged_objects_logger

And then add this line to your environment configuration file:
```ruby
config.logger = TaggedLogger.instance
```

## Usage

After configuring environment logger variable with TaggedLogger instance you can use This gem to log errors, info, bugs, warning, unknown messages and fatal errors.
This gem tags object by its class name and ID in the log file.
Log file created in log/[Rails environment].log.
Log path could be customized by passing log path while intializing TaggedLogger instance ex: TaggedLogger.instance(Log_file_path)
An Example of Log file content:
